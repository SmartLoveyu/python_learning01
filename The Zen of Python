The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated. 合成的总比难懂的好！（在复杂里面选择容易理解的。）
Flat is better than nested. 平面比嵌套好。
Sparse is better than dense. 稀疏比稠密好。
Readability counts. 可读性。
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. 特殊情况并不足以打破常规。
Although practicality beats purity. 尽管实用比过纯粹。
Errors should never pass silently. 错误永远不应该无声传递。
Unless explicitly silenced. 除非你刻意为之。
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.面对模糊不定，拒绝凭空猜测的诱惑。
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
